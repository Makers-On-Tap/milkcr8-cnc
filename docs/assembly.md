![X Mounts](./assets/images/screen_shots/x_mounts.png)

Press mounts into the sides of the tube. Sometimes these need to be pounted in with a mallet  
I usually use a 2x4 over the plastic to avoid breaking it  

## Cr8 Start

![Cross Dowel](./assets/images/img/cross_dowel.jpg)

Press the jig into large holes in the frame to align your side drills  

Drill the holes about 10mm past the dowel hole to allow for bolt clearance

![Cr8 ](./assets/images/screen_shots/cr8_start.png)

Build up Cr8 with 3 sides like this  

![X-tension ](./assets/images/screen_shots/threaded_rod.png)

Put lock washer, and nuts on the side of 2 threaded rods  

Put through the X holes  

Lie the Box on its side

![X Cr8 ](./assets/images/screen_shots/X_cr8.png)

Slide the X-Z Sub over the threaded rods all the way down. This can be a little fiddly but this is the easiest way.
