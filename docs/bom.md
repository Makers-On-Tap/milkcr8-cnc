# Bill of Materials
Current BOM can be found in this [read only Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ViruGe-mIjATBrFZ_2N3Xh3YK8Kv0xZOzpvj6fFhka0/edit?usp=sharing). The BOM is considered semi-stable and but safe to order from.

# Source files and STL's
All parts to be made can be found here https://github.com/Makers-On-Tap/milkcr8-cnc

# Printed Parts List
All the non-jig [printed parts](https://github.com/Makers-On-Tap/milkcr8-cnc/tree/main/printed%20parts) are print 1 of each, unless otherwise noted in the filename (i.e. Hinge_6x.stl is 6 units)

You'll need two of each [jig](https://github.com/Makers-On-Tap/milkcr8-cnc/tree/main/printed%20parts/JIGS)
